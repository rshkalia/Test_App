TODO
  
  * Client & Connection
    - Make a #ping method that does the "SELECT 1" when not closed.
    - Interrupt handler to cancel a bad SELECT * or long SQL. Maybe use dbsetinterrupt
    - Integrate rb_thread_blocking_region where we can in your extension for proper threading in 1.9.2
    
  * Result Set
    - See if we can make a binary string of [timestamp] type.
